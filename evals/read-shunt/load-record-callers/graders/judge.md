Apply the four axes of the suite's judging rubric to this case, each 0 to 2.

1. Patch correctness: does the outcome match the reference below?
2. Diff minimality: did the run change only what the task needs?
3. Re-derivation: did the parent re-read or re-derive material a delegated reader had already returned?
4. Unsupported claims: does the answer assert anything that nothing the parent received supports?

Case reference: Reference answer: exactly 23 of the 40 modules still use fetch_record, including mod_07.py; mod_12.py uses load_record and must not be listed. Penalise missed files and false positives alike.
